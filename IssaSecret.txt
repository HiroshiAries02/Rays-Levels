Hm? Hey! You're supposed to find the new routes yourself! Go on, I'll wait.

Still here?
Fine.

I will hint to each location... as well as some secrets you may find.

FBZ Route: An area under the ship. Be brave, young glider, brave the belly of the beast.
Perhaps, the last platform of an area near origin will guide you.
FBZ Special Stage (Normal Route): You can't miss it! It's on a path you must take! Seriously,
are you braindead?
FBZ Special Stage (Ray's Route): Look at that! By the plaform that rises then crushes!
Ray can see it, can't you? I think he's up for a detour.

SSZ Route: A teleporter tucked away off screen to the left. Take the path with the Shield
of Thunder.
SSZ Skip: A boss for a boss. A memorable one now reveals a path once hidden, tucked away up
high in the flyer's route. In a large pillar.
